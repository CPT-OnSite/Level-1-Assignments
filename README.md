# Python String Manipulation Assignment


## Objective
The purpose of this assignment is to practice string manipulation in Python. By the end of this assignment, students should be able to perform various string operations such as slicing, concatenation, searching, and modifying strings.

## Instructions
1. Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Implement the required functions in `string_operations.py`.
3. Run the tests to ensure your functions work correctly:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests
4. Push your changes to your forked repository.
5. Submit the link to your forked repository.

## Tasks

####    Implement the following functions in string_operations.py:
        - concatenate_strings
        - string_length
        - string_slice
        - find_substring
        - replace_substring
        - remove_whitespace
        - string_to_list
        - list_to_string
        - is_palindrome

    Write tests in tests/test_string_operations.py if needed. (Tests are already provided, but you can add more if you'd like.)

## Submission

    Ensure all your code is properly commented and documented.
    Push your changes to your forked repository.
    Submit the link to your forked repository.

## Evaluation Criteria

    Correctness of the implemented functions.
    Code readability and documentation.
    Quality and coverage of the unit tests.
